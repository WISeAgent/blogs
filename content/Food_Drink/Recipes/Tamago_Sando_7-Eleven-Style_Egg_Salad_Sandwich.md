# Tamago Sando: 7-Eleven-Style Egg Salad Sandwich

![Egg Salad Sandwich](https://via.placeholder.com/150)

## Ingredients
- 2 slices of **Japanese milk bread (shokupan)**
- 2 hard-boiled **eggs**
- 3 tablespoons **Kewpie mayonnaise**
- Salt and pepper, to taste

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Bread**  
   Lightly butter one side of each slice of bread. This adds a nice richness to the sandwich.

2. **Make the Egg Salad**  
   Peel and chop the hard-boiled eggs. In a bowl, mix the chopped eggs with Kewpie mayonnaise, salt, and pepper until well combined. The mayonnaise should be smooth and creamy.

3. **Assemble the Sandwich**  
   Spread the egg salad mixture evenly over the unbuttered side of one slice of bread. Place the other slice of bread on top, buttered side facing out.

4. **Serve**  
   Trim off the crusts if desired, and cut the sandwich in half diagonally to make two triangles. Enjoy your homemade Tamago Sando!

> **Note:** You can customize your sandwich by adding finely chopped herbs, like chives or parsley, for an extra burst of flavor.

## Tips for the Perfect Tamago Sando
- Use **fresh, high-quality eggs** for the best flavor.
- **Chill the egg salad** for a bit before assembling the sandwich for easier handling.
- If you can't find Japanese milk bread, use the softest, freshest white bread available.

Enjoy making and tasting this delicious Japanese convenience store classic at home!
