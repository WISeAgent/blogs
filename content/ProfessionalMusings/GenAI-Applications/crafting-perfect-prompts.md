``` javascript
/*
Objective: Build a Mobile-First Responsive Website using a specific JavaScript framework.

Requirements:
1. Summary Pane: Positioned at the top, spans the viewport width, contains placeholder content like "blah".
2. Navigation Pane: Loaded dynamically from `webconfig.yaml`, adjusts layout:
   - Small screens: Moves beneath summary pane, transforms into clapped dropdown menu.
   - Medium screens: Clapped but remains on the left side.
   - Large screens: Fully expanded on the left.
3. Content Pane: Fills remaining viewport space with placeholder content.
   - Large screens: Two resizable columns separated by draggable divider.
   - Medium/small screens: Converts into two stacked rows.
4. Framework Integration: Choose a specific JavaScript framework like React, Angular, or Vue.
5. Styling: Utilize Bootstrap for responsive design and aesthetics.
6. No Scrollbars: Ensure layout fits entirely within viewport dimensions.

**Sample Prompt for ChatGPT**:

``` markdown
## Objective:
Create a **mobile-first, responsive Next.js website** with a dynamically loaded navigation panel.

## Requirements:
1. Use **Next.js** (instead of Create React App).
2. Implement **Bootstrap** for styling.
3. **No scrollbars**: Ensure the UI dynamically adjusts to fit the viewport.
4. Layout behavior:
   - **Summary Pane**: Fixed at the top, spans full width.
   - **Navigation Pane** (loaded from `webconfig.yaml`):
     - **Small screens**: Dropdown under the summary.
     - **Medium screens**: Collapsed on the left.
     - **Large screens**: Fully expanded on the left.
   - **Content Pane**:
     - **Large screens**: Two **resizable** columns.
     - **Medium/small screens**: Converts into two stacked rows.

## Context:
- I’m using **Next.js with TypeScript**.
- The project should be set up via a **Bash script** (`setup.sh`).
- The script should install dependencies, create necessary directories/files, and generate boilerplate components.

## Rules:
1. **Mobile-First Approach**: Use media queries for responsiveness.
2. **No unnecessary dependencies**.
3. The script should support a **custom project name** (default: `chat`).

## Output Format:
- Provide a **Bash script** in a single code block (triple backticks).
- Include inline comments in the script for clarity.
- At the end, provide a **brief explanation** of the generated files.
```

**Why This Works for ChatGPT**:  

The structured, Markdown-formatted prompt guides ChatGPT through the task by breaking it into clear, manageable sections. This method helps the AI focus on one part of the problem at a time, reducing ambiguity and improving output quality. It is especially effective for technical tasks as it ensures that both the conceptual and implementation aspects are addressed in detail, making it ideal for users who require in-depth support.

``` text
Build responsive website:
- Framework: React
- Styling: Bootstrap
- Features:
  - Summary Pane: Top, spans viewport, placeholder content.
  - Navigation Pane: Responsive (dropdown, collapsed, expanded).
  - Content Pane: Resizable columns (large), stacked rows (medium/small).
  - No Scrollbars: Fit layout to viewport.
```

**Why This Works for Grok**:  
The pseudo-code format aligns with Grok’s preference for concise, structured prompts. It minimizes ambiguity and ensures the AI focuses on the technical aspects of the task.
