## 🔹 Accessing and Cleaning the Burr Grinder
Once the hopper is removed, you’ll see the **grinder assembly** with two burrs: an upper burr (removable) and lower burr (fixed).

### 💡 Upper Burr Removal — Using the “ALIGN” and “LOCK” System
1. **Locate the “ALIGN” Symbol**  
   Found on the outer ring near the burr.

2. **Twist to “ALIGN”**  
   - Grip the burr edges or handle.  
   - Turn counter-clockwise until the indicator lines up with “ALIGN.”  
   - This unlocks the burr for removal.

3. **Lift Out**  
   Gently lift the upper burr straight up.

## 🔹 Cleaning the Burrs
- **Upper Burr**: Brush off residue with a soft dry brush.  
- **Lower Burr & Chamber**: Use a small vacuum or brush — avoid water unless your model allows.  
- **Don’t Use Water on Electrical Parts**.

## 🔹 Reassembly
1. **Insert the Upper Burr**  
   Align with “ALIGN” and twist clockwise to “LOCK.”

2. **Reinstall the Hopper**  
   - Place it back on top.  
   - Lock it by turning the knob clockwise.

3. **Power On and Test**  
   Run a test shot or grind cycle to make sure everything’s seated properly.
