# 🥐 6-Day Meal Plan Using Costco's Kirkland Croissants (With Low-Sugar Dessert Options!)

Costco’s Kirkland French Butter Croissants come in a 12-pack and are flaky, buttery, and surprisingly versatile. Whether you're planning breakfasts, lunches, snacks, or even desserts, these croissants can carry you through nearly a full week of meals. Here's a 6-day plan that makes the most of them—plus smart storage tips and low-sugar dessert ideas along the way.

---

## 🧊 Storage Plan First!

- **Room Temp (Days 1–2)**: Keep 4 croissants in the original container or an airtight bag.
- **Freeze (Days 3–6)**: Individually wrap 8 croissants in foil or plastic wrap, then store in a ziplock freezer bag. Thaw overnight or microwave for 20–30 seconds wrapped in a paper towel.

> **Tip:** Day-old croissants are ideal for toasting or baking-based recipes like puddings or sandwiches.

## 🍽️ Day 1

- **Breakfast**: Scrambled eggs + cheddar in a toasted croissant  
- **Lunch**: Ham, Swiss, and Dijon mustard croissant sandwich  
- **Snack**: Half croissant with almond butter and banana slices  
- **Dessert**: **Mini Croissant Ice Cream Sandwich** — Use a low-sugar vanilla ice cream, sandwich it inside a lightly toasted croissant, then freeze for 10 minutes.

---

## 🍽️ Day 2

- **Breakfast**: Croissant French toast (made with egg, a splash of milk, cinnamon, and vanilla)  
- **Lunch**: Turkey, brie, and cranberry sauce (no-sugar-added) on croissant  
- **Snack**: Croissant with Greek yogurt and strawberries
