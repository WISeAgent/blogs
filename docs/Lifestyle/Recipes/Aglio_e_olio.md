Emulsion in Aglio e Olio:
Creating an Emulsion: When making aglio e olio, you combine the starchy pasta water with the oil and garlic. The starch from the pasta water helps to bind the oil and water together, creating an emulsion. This process transforms the oil and water into a creamy, sauce-like consistency that clings to the pasta.

Steps to Emulsify:

Cook Pasta: Cook the pasta in salted boiling water until al dente. Reserve some of the pasta water before draining.

Prepare the Sauce: In a separate pan, gently cook sliced garlic in olive oil until it is fragrant but not browned.

Combine and Emulsify: Add the cooked pasta to the pan with the garlic and oil. Pour in a small amount of the reserved pasta water and toss vigorously. The starches in the water will help to emulsify the oil, creating a silky sauce.
