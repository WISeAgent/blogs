You’re in for a treat—1 cm slices of BBQ pork are perfect for the air fryer: thin enough to crisp up beautifully, thick enough to stay juicy. Here’s a simple approach to get that sticky, smoky goodness:

### 🔥 Air Fryer BBQ Pork Slices (1 cm thick)

**Prep Time:** 10 min  
**Cook Time:** ~20–25 min  
**Temp:** 200°C (392°F)

#### 🧂 Ingredients
- Pork slices (1 cm thick, belly or shoulder work great)
- Olive oil (1–2 tsp)
- Salt & pepper
- Garlic powder or granules
- Smoked paprika (optional)
- Your favourite BBQ sauce

#### 🍳 Instructions
1. **Pat dry** the pork slices with paper towel.
2. **Season** with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika. Drizzle with olive oil and rub evenly.
3. **Preheat** your air fryer to 200°C.
4. **Arrange** slices in a single layer (don’t overcrowd).
5. **Cook** for 15 minutes, flipping halfway.
6. **Baste** with BBQ sauce and cook another 5–10 minutes until caramelized and crispy.
7. **Rest** for 2–3 minutes before serving.
