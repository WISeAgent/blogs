Vague requests often lead to vague responses. Instead of asking \\"Can you help with my website?\\", try \\"I need assistance designing a mobile-first React website with specific navigation requirements.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n### Provide Context\\r\\n\\r\\nContext is crucial for Claude to understand the full scope of your request. Include relevant background information about your project, goals, and constraints. This helps Claude tailor responses to your specific situation rather than providing generic advice.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Use Step-by-Step Instructions\\r\\n\\r\\nFor complex requests, break down what you need into clear, sequential steps. This helps Claude process your request methodically and ensures nothing gets overlooked.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Include Examples\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen possible, provide examples of what you\'re looking for. This gives Claude a concrete reference point and increases the likelihood of getting a response that matches your expectations.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Advanced Prompting Techniques\\r\\n\\r\\n### Structured Formatting\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most effective techniques I\'ve discovered is using structured formatting in prompts. This can be done using either Markdown or plain text with clear organization:\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Markdown Example:\\r\\n```markdown\\r\\n# Project Title\\r\\n\\r\\n## Context\\r\\nBrief background information\\r\\n\\r\\n## Requirements\\r\\n- Requirement 1\\r\\n- Requirement 2\\r\\n\\r\\n## Deliverables\\r\\n1. First deliverable\\r\\n2. Second deliverable\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n#### Plain Text Alternative:\\r\\n```\\r\\nPROJECT TITLE\\r\\n\\r\\nCONTEXT:\\r\\nBrief background information\\r\\n\\r\\nREQUIREMENTS:\\r\\n- Requirement 1\\r\\n- Requirement 2\\r\\n\\r\\nDELIVERABLES:\\r\\n1. First deliverable\\r\\n2. Second deliverable\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth approaches create visual hierarchy that helps Claude parse and understand different components of your request.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Specify Personas or Voice\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you need Claude to respond in a particular tone or style, explicitly request it. For example: \\"Please explain this concept as if you were teaching a 10-year-old\\" or \\"Write this in the style of a formal business proposal.\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n### Request Reasoning\\r\\n\\r\\nFor complex tasks, ask Claude to explain its thinking or approach.
