    <h1>The Neural Network Renaissance</h1>
<p>Building on <a href="https://wiseagent.github.io/blogs/LinkedIN_post20250309.html">AI Evolution Overview: The Spark of Curiosity</a>’s look at AI’s early days, let’s explore a turning point: the neural network resurgence. In the 1980s and 90s, these systems broke free from symbolic AI’s rigid rules, redefining how machines learn and engage with the world. For me, this era hit home—my Master’s research on artificial neural networks (ANNs) began here, sparking a lifelong fascination.</p>

<h2>The 80s and 90s Boom</h2>
<p>The 1980s reignited neural networks with <em>backpropagation</em>—an algorithm that fine-tuned errors across layers using the chain rule. This breakthrough unlocked deeper, more complex models. By the 1990s, pattern recognition soared, with machines mastering speech and images in ways once deemed human-only. It was a bold leap forward.</p>

<h2>The Tech That Changed Everything</h2>
<h3>Brain-Inspired Learning</h3>
<p>Neural networks mimicked the brain’s wiring. Their essence? Modeling patterns by minimizing squared error—think polynomial regression, but stretched into multi-dimensional, non-linear realms. Early ANNs used this “squared error” to gauge prediction gaps, refining themselves via gradient descent—a simple yet powerful tweak.</p>
<h3>Data’s Double Edge</h3>
<p>Success relied on <em>training data</em>. Quality data boosted accuracy; poor choices bred bias, skewing outputs. Sometimes, training hit <em>divergence</em>, veering off course. These hiccups pushed researchers to sharpen data curation and optimization tricks.</p>
<h3>Beyond Rules</h3>
<p>Unlike symbolic AI’s stiff frameworks, neural networks learned from examples, adapting fluidly. This opened doors to machines “seeing” images and “hearing” sounds—foundations for today’s tech.</p>

<h2>Real-World Wins</h2>
<p>The impact was swift. Neural networks powered handwriting recognition, revolutionizing mail sorting, while early voice systems hinted at future assistants. These weren’t just theories—they solved problems, fueling innovation.</p>
