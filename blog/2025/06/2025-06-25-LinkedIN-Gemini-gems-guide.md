# Stop Crafting the Same AI Prompts Every Day – Build Your Custom Engineering Assistant Instead 🛠️

**Tired of repeating "You're a senior Python developer..." in every ChatGPT conversation?** 

Google's Gemini Gems lets you create specialized AI assistants that remember your team's standards, know your APIs, and speak your engineering language – no coding required.

## What Are Gems?

Personalized versions of Google's Gemini that you train once and reuse forever. Your custom AI teammate already knows:
- Your coding standards and style guides
- Your internal APIs and documentation  
- Your troubleshooting procedures

## The Transformation

**Before:** "Where's our API documentation? Let me craft another prompt..."
**After:** "Hey Code Reviewer, check this pull request against our standards."

## Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

1. Go to [gemini.google.com](https://gemini.google.com) → "Gems"
2. Create your assistant:

```
Name: API Expert
Instructions: You're our internal API assistant. Provide working code examples with proper auth. Reference uploaded specs. Include error handling and rate limits.
```

3. Upload knowledge files: API specs, style guides, runbooks (up to 10 files)
4. Test and refine

## Game-Changing Use Cases

**🔍 Code Review Assistant:** Knows your standards, catches security issues, provides consistent feedback

**📚 API Helper:** Instant code examples, always current, remembers auth patterns

**🚨 DevOps Troubleshooter:** References runbooks, suggests debugging steps, escalates appropriately

**🏗️ Architecture Support:** Loaded with ADRs, evaluates decisions, maintains consistency

## The Secret Weapon: Knowledge Files

Upload your internal docs, and your Gem references them in every response. This ensures accuracy that generic AI can't match.

## Pro Tips

- **Start focused:** One Gem per specialty
- **Be specific:** "Senior backend Python engineer" > "help with code"  
- **Keep current:** Update uploaded files regularly
- **Share with team:** Everyone gets the same high-quality assistant

## Beyond Individual Use

Gems work in Gmail, Docs, Sheets, and Drive. Your custom assistant follows you across Google Workspace.

## The Bottom Line

Stop re-explaining context to AI. Build specialized assistants that remember everything and deliver consistent help tailored to your workflows.
