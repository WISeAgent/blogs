🚀 STOP Using ChatGPT in Your Browser - Google's Gemini CLI Just Changed Everything for Developers!

If you're still copy-pasting code between terminal and ChatGPT, you're doing it wrong. Google's Gemini CLI brings conversational AI directly into your command line - it's game-changing.

🔥 Why Developers Love This:

✅ FULL PROJECT CONTEXT: Analyze entire codebase with --all-files flag
✅ SECURE SANDBOX: Test AI code safely in isolated containers  
✅ INTERACTIVE DEBUGGING: Real-time help in your terminal workflow
✅ FREE TIER: Just need a Google account - no API keys required

🛠️ Getting Started:

Installation:
```
npx @google/gemini-cli                    # Instant run
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli         # Global install
```

Authentication: Run `gemini` and sign in with Google. Done.

💡 Real Use Cases:

🔍 CODE REVIEWS: `gemini --all-files --prompt "Review for security issues"`
🐛 DEBUGGING: `gemini --debug --prompt "Debug this error: $(cat error.log)"`
📝 DOCS: `gemini --all-files --prompt "Generate README"`
🧪 TESTING: `gemini --sandbox --prompt "Test this script safely"`

⚡ Power Features:
• Gemini 2.5 Flash (fast) or Pro (complex tasks)
• Include/exclude directories: `--include-directories src,tests`
• Checkpointing for long sessions
• Memory monitoring for large projects

🎯 Pro Tips:
1. Start from project root for best context
2. Use `--sandbox` for code execution
3. Be specific: "Review auth module for JWT vulnerabilities"
4. Use interactive mode for complex tasks

🚨 Watch Out For:
• Requires Node.js 18+
• Be selective with `--all-files` on sensitive projects
• Review AI commands before running

The learning curve? Nearly zero. If you use npm and basic command-line, you're ready.

This isn't just another AI tool - it's a fundamental shift. Instead of context-switching between browser and terminal, everything happens in your natural workflow.

I've used it for code reviews, docs, and debugging. Having AI conversations about your actual codebase, with full context, without leaving terminal is incredibly powerful.

Best part? Open-source and Google-backed.
