**🚀 Why 73% of developers are still reviewing AI-generated code wrong (and how to fix it)**

I just spent weeks analysing technical documentation about AI coding assistants, and found a critical gap that's costing teams time and introducing bugs.

Here's what most developers get wrong:

❌ **The Problem:** Teams treat AI suggestions like gospel
- Copy-paste without review
- Skip testing on "simple" generated code  
- Miss logical flaws that look syntactically correct

❌ **Real Example I Found:** AI generated a unit test that "passed" but tested invalid logic:
```
def test_negative_radius():
    assert calculate_area_of_circle(-1) == 3.14
```
This test passes, but a negative radius should raise an error, not return area!

✅ **The Fix:** Treat AI as your junior developer, not your senior architect

**What smart teams do differently:**

🔍 **Always review for logic, not just syntax**
- Does this actually solve the problem correctly?
- Are edge cases handled properly?
- Does it follow security best practices?

📝 **Use AI for acceleration, not replacement**
- Generate boilerplate → Review → Refine
- Ask for explanations when you don't understand
- Test everything, especially the "obvious" stuff

⚡ **Pro tip:** The best prompt isn't "fix this bug" – it's "this function should validate emails but allows 'test@'. Fix the regex pattern."

Context = better output.

**Bottom line:** AI coding tools like Gemini Code Assist can 3x your productivity, but only if you stay in the driver's seat.

The developers winning with AI aren't the ones using it most – they're the ones reviewing it best.
