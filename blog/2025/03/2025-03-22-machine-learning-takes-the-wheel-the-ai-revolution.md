## A Perfect Storm of Data, Compute, and Algorithms

The 2010s marked a watershed moment. Advancements in computational power, the explosion of massive datasets, and breakthrough neural architectures converged to make machine learning revolutionary. For decades, AI relied on hand-crafted rules or basic statistical methods, but modern approaches enabled models to extract patterns directly from raw data.

- **2011:** IBM Watson defeated Jeopardy! champions through advanced natural language processing.
- **2012:** AlexNet revolutionized computer vision by dramatically reducing ImageNet error rates using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- **2016:** AlphaGo defeated the world Go champion, conquering a game with more possible positions than atoms in the universe.

## The Rise of AI Businesses

This era saw AI move from research labs to real-world applications:
- **Healthcare**: ML models detecting diseases from medical images
- **Finance**: Automated trading systems and fraud detection
- **Transportation**: Progress toward self-driving vehicles
- **Entertainment**: Recommendation systems reshaping content delivery

## Big Tech's AI Arms Race

Tech giants raced to acquire AI startups and talent:
- Google acquired DeepMind for £400 million
- Microsoft invested heavily in OpenAI
- Amazon and Apple enhanced their AI capabilities
- Meta (formerly Facebook) doubled down on AI research

## Looking Ahead

Machine Learning's impact continues growing. Join us next time as we explore deep learning—a specialized branch that's pushing the boundaries of what AI can achieve.
