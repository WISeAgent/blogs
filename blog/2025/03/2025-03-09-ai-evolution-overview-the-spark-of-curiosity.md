# AI Evolution Overview: The Spark of Curiosity

During my Master's research on artificial neural networks (ANNs) thirty years ago, I first immersed myself in AI—a field where the future was rapidly unfolding. Now, returning after a long hiatus, I'm inspired by the groundbreaking advances and profound social impact of AI. Motivated by these breakthroughs, I've decided to share this series to explore AI's evolution—from its early theoretical roots to today's transformative innovations.

## Milestone Snapshots

**1950s: Symbolic AI**  
Early AI research relied on symbolic reasoning and rule-based systems to simulate human thought. Pioneering work in formal logic and search algorithms laid the conceptual groundwork for later developments.

**1960s: Expert Systems**  
The emergence of expert systems saw AI applied to practical problems using if-then rules and knowledge bases. Technologies like MYCIN demonstrated how machines could mimic expert decision-making, even as they struggled with the complexity of real-world variability.
