# The Neural Network Renaissance

Building on the AI Evolution Overview's look at AI's early days, let's explore a turning point: the neural network resurgence. In the 1980s and 90s, these systems broke free from symbolic AI's rigid rules, redefining how machines learn and engage with the world. For me, this era hit home—my Master's research on artificial neural networks (ANNs) began here, sparking a lifelong fascination.

## The 80s and 90s Boom

The 1980s reignited neural networks with *backpropagation*—an algorithm that fine-tuned errors across layers using the chain rule. This breakthrough unlocked deeper, more complex models. By the 1990s, pattern recognition soared, with machines mastering speech and images in ways once deemed human-only. It was a bold leap forward.

## The Tech That Changed Everything

ANNs revolutionized computing by learning from data rather than following explicit rules. From optical character recognition to early speech systems, they proved their worth in real applications. The key was their ability to find patterns in messy, real-world data.

## Real-World Wins

The impact was swift. Neural networks powered handwriting recognition, revolutionizing mail sorting, while early voice systems hinted at future assistants. These weren't just theories—they solved problems, fueling innovation.
