<h1>AI Evolution Overview: The Spark of Curiosity</h1>
<p><img src="AI-timeline.png" alt="AI Milestones timeline"></p>
<p>During my Master’s research on artificial neural networks (ANNs) thirty years ago, I first immersed myself in AI—a field where the future was rapidly unfolding. Now, returning after a long hiatus, I'm inspired by the groundbreaking advances and profound social impact of AI. Motivated by these breakthroughs, I’ve decided to share this series to explore AI’s evolution—from its early theoretical roots to today’s transformative innovations.</p>
<h2>Milestone Snapshots</h2>
<p><strong>1950s: Symbolic AI</strong><br>
Early AI research relied on symbolic reasoning and rule-based systems to simulate human thought. Pioneering work in formal logic and search algorithms laid the conceptual groundwork for later developments.</p>
<p><strong>1960s: Expert Systems</strong><br>
The emergence of expert systems saw AI applied to practical problems using if-then rules and knowledge bases. Technologies like MYCIN demonstrated how machines could mimic expert decision-making, even as they struggled with the complexity of real-world variability.</p>
<p><strong>1970s: AI Winter</strong><br>
High expectations and technological limitations led to the AI Winter—a period marked by reduced funding and critical reassessment. This era highlighted the challenges of scalability and real-world applicability, ultimately prompting researchers to refine their approaches.</p>
<p><strong>1980s: Neural Networks Revival</strong><br>
The revival of neural networks in the 1980s, driven by the breakthrough of backpropagation, allowed for the training of multi-layer models. This resurgence reinvigorated connectionist approaches, setting the stage for the deep learning innovations of later decades.</p>
<p><strong>1990s: Pattern Recognition Advances</strong><br>
In the 1990s, advances in statistical methods and increased computational power significantly improved pattern recognition. Techniques such as support vector machines and Bayesian networks enhanced the ability of systems to interpret complex data, paving the way for more robust AI applications.</p>
<p><strong>2000s: Machine Learning Breakthroughs</strong><br>
The explosion of digital data and enhanced computing capabilities in the 2000s catalyzed machine learning breakthroughs. Innovations in algorithms—from decision trees to ensemble methods—enabled systems to learn autonomously and adapt to ever-growing datasets.</p>
<p><strong>2010s: Rise of Deep Learning</strong><br>
The 2010s witnessed a deep learning revolution powered by GPU computing and massive datasets. Architectures like convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and autoencoders achieved significant strides in image, speech, and natural language processing, transforming entire industries.</p>
<p><strong>2020s: Generative AI Revolution</strong><br>
Today, generative models such as transformers and diffusion models are redefining AI’s potential. Tools like ChatGPT and DALL-E are not only reshaping creative industries but also opening new avenues for human-AI collaboration, marking a revolutionary leap in the field.<br>
